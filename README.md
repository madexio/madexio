Hi, I’m @madexio also known as Matthew!
I am a University of Victoria graduate.
I’m interested in gamedev, although due to school I have a lot of prototypes going on here that I plan to come back to once I have more time.
I'm also just generally passionate about programming and love to play around with different small projects.
